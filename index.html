      <br>Planting is when we put seeds or young plants into the ground so they have the chance to grow. It's vital to provide them with the right amount of water, sunlight, and care so they can stay healthy. Through planting, we can grow edible food, plants, flowers, or parts of trees to use, and enjoy. Plants also help with cleaning the air, and provide oxygen we breathe. Planting teaches us patience, because it takes time to see it grow. Planting also connects us to nature and reminds us we are part of a greater ecosystem. Through planting, we create life which benefits us all, and the world around us.
